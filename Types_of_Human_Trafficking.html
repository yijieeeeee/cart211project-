<h2 id="section-6">Types of human trafficking</h2>

<p><a href="#services">Sex trafficking</a>, <a href="#labour">labour trafficking</a> and forced marriage are types of human
  trafficking.</p>

<h3 id="services">Sex trafficking</h3>

<p>Sex traffickers purposely develop a bond with the person they are trafficking and manipulate them by making them believe they are better off staying than leaving. For this and other reasons, the trafficked person may fear and resist
  police intervention. This bond is developed in stages, over time.</p>

<p>This is different from sex work, where the person is over 18 and legally able to consent.</p>

<h4>How recruitment into sex trafficking can happen</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h5>Luring</h5>
    The sex trafficker can be a stranger, someone connected to the victim through social media or someone they know personally. The trafficker may suddenly be very interested in the victim, say nice things, take them out and spend
    money on them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Grooming</h5>
    The sex trafficker may act like a generous boyfriend or friend, make the victim feel adored and spend money on things like lingerie, accessories and new clothes. They may also try to get the victim to look older or sexier and push
    their boundaries by trying out risky behaviours, such as trying drugs or alcohol, missing school or other extracurricular activities and taking sexually explicit photos.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Isolation</h5>
    The sex trafficker may try to distance the victim from friends and family, and make the victim feel like they are the only person who cares about them. This helps the trafficker assert control.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Manipulation</h5>
    At some point the sex trafficker will ask the victim to do sexual things with them or others to “repay” them for the money that has been spent on them, to maintain their new lifestyle or to earn money for their future together. The
    sex trafficker may also tell the victim that the victim owes someone money and something bad will happen to them if they don’t do what the trafficker wants.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Threats</h5>
    The sex trafficker may try to coerce the victim into sex by threatening to expose the things (e.g. explicit photographs) that they’ve done to others. They may also threaten to hurt the victim or someone they care about.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h5>Exploitation</h5>

    <p>The sex trafficker’s main goal is to control and exploit the victim by forcing them to have sex in exchange for things they need, want or for money. Traffickers may abuse a relationship of trust, authority or dependency with the
      victim in order to exploit them. &nbsp;If the victim tries to say no, the trafficker may threaten to harm them or someone they care about. Often times the victim is not fully aware that &nbsp;coercion and threatening behaviour is
      happening because they are communicated in covert ways.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>When someone is being trafficked, their traffickers often control every aspect of their life, including when they eat and sleep, what they wear and who they talk to. People who are being trafficked and people who come into contact
  with them, may not know or understand that a crime is taking place.</p>

<p>This is a broad overview of how sex trafficking may occur. Not all circumstances follow this pattern or include each of these elements.</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p>Sex trafficking is different from consensual sex work. It is illegal for someone to manipulate or exploit a person under the age of 18 into having sex in exchange for money, drugs, alcohol, shelter, transportation, food or any
    other object or necessity. The person manipulating and exploiting someone under 18 is committing a crime.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="labour">Labour trafficking</h3>

<p>Language like “forced labour,” “servant” and “servitude” are sometimes used when talking about labour trafficking. There have been labour trafficking cases involving construction, manufacturing, mining, hospitality, salons,
  agriculture, domestic work, sales and other industries.</p>

<p>Labour traffickers often take away passports and other documents, and sometimes control where the person stays. Debt bondage is a form of labour trafficking where a person is told they must work to pay off a large, unexpected and
  illegal debt.</p>

<p>People in other countries and newcomers may be recruited by someone from their home country or from Canada who makes false promises about what a job is and how much it pays. The person may not know their rights in Ontario, may not
  know how to get help and may fear reporting to police.</p>
