                <li>are being secretive about their activities</li>

          <h2 id="section-2">Help for survivors of human trafficking</h2>

          <p>Being trafficked can cause severe trauma and survivors often need intensive, specialized services and support to rebuild their lives.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="columns small-12 medium-6">
              <h3>Find services:</h3>

              <ul>
                <li><a href="/page/human-trafficking-services-and-supports#section-0">in your area</a></li>

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>It can be very difficult for a survivor to leave a trafficking situation and can take several attempts before they find help.</p>

          <h2 id="section-3">People at risk of human trafficking</h2>

          <p>Anyone can be at risk of being trafficked, however there are some risk factors that can make someone more vulnerable.</p>

          <p>People who are at higher risk of being sex trafficked are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>women and girls (though boys, men and people who are <abbr title="Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Two-Spirit">LGBTQI2S</abbr> are also targeted)</li>
            <li>homeless and marginalized youth</li>
            <li>youth who struggle with self-esteem, bullying, discrimination, poverty, abuse, isolation and other social or family issues</li>
            <li>Indigenous women and girls</li>
            <li>people with addiction, mental illness and developmental disabilities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are cases where none of these risk factors are present. In those cases, traffickers often target very young people, identify and fulfill their needs, and then use that dependence to control and exploit them.</p>

          <p><a href="#labour">Labour trafficking</a> is another type of human trafficking.
            People who are most at risk of labour trafficking include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>migrant workers</li>
            <li>newcomers to Canada</li>
            <li>people with uncertain immigration status</li>
            <li>people who are homeless</li>
            <li>people who do not speak English or French</li>
          </ul>
